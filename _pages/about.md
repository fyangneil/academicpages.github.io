I am now a Senior Computer Vision Scientist at United Imaging Intelligence, Shanghai and Boston. I was a PhD student in Department of [Computer & Information Sciences (CIS)](https://cis.temple.edu/) at Temple University and advised by Prof. [Haibin Ling](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hling/), 2016 Fall through 2020 Fall. Prior to CIS, I conduct research under the supervision by Prof. [Ying Zhu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ying-julie-zhu-00184312) for one year in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Temple University. I obtained my Master degree at [Xi'dian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/), where I worked closely with Prof. [Jimin Liang](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=SfkU4GEAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my B.S. degree from Anhui Science and Technology University. 

We are working on developing vision-based technology for **automatic operating room** and **intelligent medical device**. The involved computer vision topics include but not limit to **object detection**, **moving object detection**, **2D/3D human pose estimation**, **body mesh recovery**, **3D dynamic scene perception**. 

## Openings

We now have internship and full time openings in both Shanghai and Boston. The details of the position in Shanghai, please see [here](https://github.com/fyangneil/computer-vision-intern). For the position in Boston, you are referred to [here](http://wuziyan.com/).
