I am now a Senior Computer Vision Scientist in United Imaging Intelligence, Shanghai and Boston. I was a PhD student in Department of [Computer & Information Sciences (CIS)] (https://cis.temple.edu/) at Temple University and advised by Prof. [Haibin Ling] (https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hling/), 2016 Fall through 2020 Fall. Prior to CIS, I conduct research under the supervision by Prof. [Ying Zhu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ying-julie-zhu-00184312) for one year in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Temple University. I obtained my Master degree at [Xi'dian University] (https://en.xidian.edu.cn/), where I worked closely with Prof. [Jimin Liang](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=SfkU4GEAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my B.S. degree from Anhui Science and Technology University.
